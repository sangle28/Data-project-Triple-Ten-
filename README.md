### [1. Television Ratings Analysis](https://github.com/sangle28/Television-Ratings-Analysis)
This project focuses on a thorough analysis of data from the entertainment industry. It focuses on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999, with the release of The Sopranos. The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes.

### [3. Telecom Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/sangle28/Telecom-Hypothesis-Testing.git)
In this project, I simulate being an analyst for a telecom company. They offer two plans to their customers, and the commercial department wants to know which plan brings in the most revenue, to appropriately adjust the advertising budget. The goal is to analyze the customers' behavior and usage, to determine which plan brings in more revenue.

### [4. Used Car Data Dashboard](https://github.com/sangle28/Car-Advertisement-Dashboard.git)
This project explores creating an interactive dashboard using the Streamlit library in Python to gather insights of a dataset of used cars. Exploratory data analysis was performed in an accompanying Jupyter Notebook, along with a python file for building the dashboard, which is hosted on Render.

### [7. Telecom Plan Recommendation](https://github.com/sangle28/Telecom-Plan-Recommendation.git)
Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. We are tasked with developing a machine learning model that will analyze subscribers' behaviors, and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. The goal of this project is to develop and tune a machine learning model that recommends the correct plan with an accuracy metric of 0.75.
